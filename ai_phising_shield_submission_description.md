# AI Phishing Shield: Submission Description

## The Problem We're Solving

Mobile money has transformed financial inclusion across Africa, with over 600 million users conducting $1.4 trillion in annual transactions. However, this success has created a massive vulnerability: **33% of African cybercrimes involve phishing**, with attackers exploiting local languages, cultural contexts, and low technical literacy to steal from the most vulnerable users.

The average victim loses 2-3 months of income to a single successful attack—devastating for users who rely on mobile money for daily survival. Traditional cybersecurity solutions fail catastrophically in African contexts because they:

- Don't understand local languages (Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, Pidgin, Arabic, Amharic)
- Ignore cultural contexts (trust-based social engineering, family impersonation)
- Require constant internet connectivity (unreliable in many African regions)
- Demand high-end smartphones (most users have basic 1-2GB RAM devices)
- Drain batteries quickly (unacceptable for users without reliable power)

**The gap is clear:** 600 million people are exposed to sophisticated phishing attacks with zero effective protection.

## Our Solution: AI Phishing Shield

**AI Phishing Shield** is an offline-capable, privacy-first mobile app that provides near real-time phishing detection for SMS, notifications and messaging platforms on Android (and as a cross-platform Expo app). The implementation in the repository shows a complete pipeline: dataset, training/conversion notebooks, TFLite artifacts, Python and native runtime wrappers, and a React Native frontend.


### Core Innovation: On-Device, Explainable Detection

Key behaviors implemented in the repo:
1. Background message capture on Android using a notification-listener (with explicit user consent) — see `docs/notification-listener.md` and `android/` native service.
2. On-device inference using TensorFlow Lite — mobile and Python runtime wrappers load TFLite artifacts and measure latency at runtime (see `phishing_detector_package/` and `model-inference/inference_wrapper/infer.py`).
3. Explainable heuristics combined with model scores (urgency, links, OTP detection, keyword signals) so detections surface human-readable evidence — implemented in the inference wrappers.
4. Local persistence and optional network outbox for feedback/telemetry that only uploads when an endpoint is configured (default behavior retains entries locally) — see `lib/services/networkOutbox.ts`.

Notes about offline and resource characteristics (accurate to the repo):
- The repository contains TFLite artifacts produced from a DistilBERT-style transformer. The included artifacts are large (see Evidence below) and therefore device storage / memory needs will vary by target device.
- The inference wrappers record latency at runtime, but there is no single guaranteed "<50ms on all devices" figure in the repo — measured latency depends on the device CPU, number of threads, and which TFLite variant is used.

### Key Technical Differentiators (corrected)

- Multilingual detection: the shipped model metadata and dataset indicate training across 9 languages (English, French, Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Amharic, Arabic, and Pidgin). See `phishing_detector_package/model-metadata.json` and `phishing_dataset/`.
- Model architecture: the repo's training and conversion use a transformer (DistilBERT-style) converted to TFLite; this is not a Random Forest / TF-IDF classical model. See `notebooks/train_and_convert.ipynb` and `phishing_detector_package/README.md`.
- On-device engine: TensorFlow Lite artifacts and runtime wrappers exist for Python and Android. See `phishing_detector_package/*.tflite`, `model-inference/inference_wrapper/infer.py`, and `android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/inference/InferenceModule.java`.
- Explainability: per-language heuristic rules and evidence factors (links, urgency keywords, OTP patterns) are combined with model score to produce a human-readable detection object — implemented in the wrappers.

## Technologies Used (repo-backed)

### Mobile & Frontend
- React Native (Expo) — configured in `package.json` and `app.json` (splash changed to `#2563eb` in `app.json`).
- Android native NotificationListener integration (bridge code in `android/`).

### Model & Inference
- Training & conversion: Jupyter notebook at `notebooks/train_and_convert.ipynb` showing DistilBERT training and conversion to TFLite.
- TFLite inference: `phishing_detector_package/*.tflite` and `phishing_detector_package/model-metadata.json`.
- Runtime wrappers: Python `model-inference/inference_wrapper/infer.py` (CLI & wrapper), Android native `InferenceModule.java` for in-app inference.

### Data & Pipeline
- Multilingual dataset artifacts and processed CSVs in `phishing_dataset/` and `data/processed/` (the repository contains many tens of thousands of examples across languages; see files under `phishing_dataset/` for the actual samples included).

## Evaluation & Model Artifacts (exact repo values)

The repository includes multiple TFLite variants and a sample evaluation summary (source: `phishing_detector_package/README.md` and `model-metadata.json`):

- Artifacts shipped in repo:
	- `phishing_detector.tflite` (float16) — ~258.27 MB
	- `phishing_detector_dynamic.tflite` (dynamic) — ~129.86 MB
	- `phishing_detector_int8.tflite` (int8) — ~129.71 MB

- Metadata highlights (`phishing_detector_package/model-metadata.json`):
	- modelVersion: "v0.1.0"
	- modelName: "distilbert-multilingual-phishing-detector"
	- max_length: 128
	- heuristic_weight: 0.7
	- training_languages: ["en","fr","sw","yo","ig","ha","am","ar","pcm"]

- Sample evaluation (included in the package README; sample n=2000):
	- float16/dynamic variants: accuracy ≈ 0.9935, precision ≈ 0.9931, recall ≈ 0.9890 (on the reported sample)
	- int8 variant: accuracy ≈ 0.8315 (precision/recall trade-offs reported)

Important: these evaluation numbers are for the sample reported in the repo. Real-world performance will vary by language, message distribution, and device tokenizer parity.
