# AI Phishing Detection Hackathon - URGENT Dataset Research & Acquisition Task

## Challenge Overview
We're participating in the **AfriHackBox AI-Powered Phishing Detection Challenge** with an **8-day deadline** (currently Day 1). The goal is to build an AI system that detects phishing attempts in SMS, WhatsApp, and email for Africa's mobile money users (600M+ users, $1.4T annual transactions).

## Key Requirements
- **Detection Accuracy:** 95%+ with <2% false positives
- **Languages:** Swahili, Yoruba, Amharic, Arabic, French, Hausa (we're prioritizing: Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, Pidgin, French, Arabic, Amharic)
- **Device Constraints:** Must run on basic smartphones (1-2GB RAM)
- **Offline Operation:** 72+ hours without internet
- **Battery Efficiency:** <5% per day

## Team Composition
- 2 mobile developers
- 1 cybersecurity expert
- 1 business/entrepreneurial person
- 1 software engineer (comfortable with web, mobile, cloud)

## Current Situation

### CRITICAL BLOCKER
The hackathon organizers promised "curated datasets" worth $10K+ but they're not available yet. We've submitted a support request but can't wait for their response.

### Our Multi-Pronged Solution
1. ✅ **Crowdsourcing Campaign** - Launched (Google Form across social media)
2. ✅ **Synthetic Data Generator** - Built (generates 1,300+ messages per language for 9 languages: English, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, Pidgin, French, Arabic, Amharic)
3. 🔥 **PUBLIC DATASET ACQUISITION** - **THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN**

## Timeline Context
- **TODAY (Day 1):** Dataset research & acquisition ← **WE ARE HERE**
- **Tomorrow (Day 2):** Dataset processing + model selection
- **Days 3-4:** Model training + mobile app foundation
- **Days 5-6:** Integration + testing
- **Days 7-8:** Polish + submission

**We need a complete, production-ready dataset by END OF TODAY.**

# 🎯 PRIMARY TASK: BUILD US A COMPLETE DATASET

## Your Mission

You are a data scientist hired to **build a production-ready multilingual phishing detection dataset**. We received a research brief from Gemini AI with 20 potential sources. Your job is to:

1. **Research every single source** - Verify accessibility, explore actual content
2. **Download/Access all viable datasets** - Get the actual data
3. **Process & clean the data** - Standardize formats, labels, remove noise
4. **Combine datasets intelligently** - Merge sources without introducing bias
5. **Validate quality** - Ensure the final dataset is training-ready
6. **Deliver the complete dataset** - As CSV/JSON with proper documentation

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You must deliver:**
- ✅ A combined dataset with **minimum 20,000 messages**
- ✅ Coverage for **at least 5 languages** (English, French, Swahili + 2 African languages)
- ✅ Balanced labels (30-40% phishing, 60-70% legitimate)
- ✅ Proper columns: `message`, `label`, `language`, `source`, `scam_type`
- ✅ Documentation: Stats, source breakdown, processing notes
- ✅ Ready-to-use train/validation/test splits

**DO NOT just give us instructions. We need the actual processed dataset files.**

# 📚 FULL GEMINI RESEARCH BRIEF

## Context from Gemini

Since we don't have the curated dataset yet, this is actually a golden opportunity. We can build our own foundational understanding and even create a baseline model. This will put us miles ahead when the official data is released.

### Phase 1: Research & Data (The Proactive Approach)

Our goal is to understand the enemy. What do these phishing messages actually look like in Africa? How do they manipulate people?

We will tackle this in two parts:

**Find Public Datasets to Act as Proxies:** We'll find existing public datasets for SMS spam and phishing. While they won't have the specific cultural nuances, they are essential for building and testing our initial data processing and modeling pipeline.

**Research African Phishing Tactics:** We will become domain experts by researching the specific strategies scammers use in our target regions.

### Part 1: Gathering Proxy Datasets

While we await the official data, we can start with publicly available datasets. This allows us to write code for data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.

Here's what Gemini found and how we can use it:

**For English & French:** The UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset is a well-known benchmark. Several versions exist on platforms like Kaggle, some of which have been machine-translated into other languages, including French. There's also a corpus of over 88,000 authentic French SMS messages which could be invaluable for understanding the language's informal, text-based nature.

**For Swahili:** While a direct "phishing" dataset is rare, there are several Swahili news classification datasets available. We can use the non-news text (the "ham") from these to teach our model what normal Swahili looks like. We'll have to be creative and likely generate or manually label some Swahili phishing examples.

**For Yoruba & Other African Languages:** A dataset with "African-English context" was collected in Nigeria, which could be very useful for understanding local phrasing. Zindi, a platform for African data science challenges, is another excellent resource to monitor for datasets in our target languages.

**General Phishing:** There are multiple general-purpose smishing (SMS phishing) datasets on GitHub and Mendeley Data that consolidate messages from public sources. These are great for training our model on the fundamental structure of phishing messages.

**Action Plan for Data:** We'll start by downloading the UCI dataset and one of its multilingual versions. This gives us English and French data to build our initial model. We will then incorporate the Swahili news data to help the model learn that language.

### Part 2: Researching Cultural Context & Phishing Patterns

This is where we go beyond generic spam. The hackathon explicitly states that traditional solutions fail because they "don't understand African languages, cultural nuances, or the technical constraints."

Research into common mobile money and online scams in Africa reveals several recurring themes that we must teach our model to recognize:

**Impersonation is Key:** Scammers frequently pose as representatives from mobile money operators (like M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money), banks, or even family members.

**The "Mistaken Transfer" Scam:** A very common tactic involves a scammer sending a fake alert that money was sent to the victim's account, followed by a desperate call or text asking for the money to be "refunded." The victim, wanting to be honest, sends their own money without verifying their balance.

**Exploiting Trust and Authority:** Messages might reference government grants, fake job offers with "application fees," or use titles like "Uncle" or "Auntie" to create a false sense of familiarity and trust.

**SIM Swap Fraud:** The underlying threat for many attacks is SIM swapping, where a fraudster convinces a mobile operator to transfer the victim's number to a new SIM card they control, giving them access to everything. While we can't detect the swap itself, we can detect the social engineering messages that often precede it (e.g., asking for personal details to "verify your account").

**Urgency and Scarcity:** Like phishing everywhere, messages create a sense of urgency (e.g., "your account will be suspended," "claim your prize NOW") to prevent victims from thinking critically.

About Dataset
Context
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

Content
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

This corpus has been collected from free or free for research sources at the Internet:

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is: [Web Link].
-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The NUS SMS Corpus is avalaible at: [Web Link].
-> A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at [Web Link].
-> Finally, we have incorporated the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. It has 1,002 SMS ham messages and 322 spam messages and it is public available at: [Web Link]. This corpus has been used in the following academic researches:

SMS-Spam-Dataset
This ExAIS_SMS Spam dataset was a project conducted at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria with the aim of building an indigenous SMS Spam corpus with African-English context. The dataset was collected from the above stated community with the consent of each particpant for the purpose of contributing and developing SMS corpus to aid further detection of SMS spam.

The SMS dataset collected from 20 users of different mobile devices within the University community from both students, faculty member and non-teaching staff within the age group of 20-50 years old. A total of 5,240 SMS messages which consist of 2,350 Spam messages and 2,890 Ham (non-spam) messages was collected. Aside from the textual content, their are also some metadata included in the data such as users’ contact list, time stamp, date, sender's details, and their corresponding SMS messages.

What am we trying to achieve with this SMS? This repository contains the raw SMS data. However, we have tried to mask some vital informations within the SMS such as bank account, phone numbers with the SMS, with the aim of ensuring users private details safety.

The total number of SMS messages for each participant (in CSV) and their metadata is as follows:

• User 1 contains 53 messages.

• User 2 contains 130 messages.

• User 3 contains 23 messages.

• User 4 contains 182 messages.

• User 5 contains 122 messages.

• User 6 contains 116 messages.

• User 7 contains 235 messages.

• User 8 contains 34 messages.

• User 9 contains 49 messages.

• User 10 contains 633 messages.

• User 11 contains 243 messages.

• User 12 contains 387 messages.

• User 13 contains 117 messages.

• User 14 contains 227 messages.

• User 15 contains 605 messages.

• User 1 6contains 1082 messages.

• User 17 contains 180 messages.

• User 18 contains 167 messages.

• User 19 contains 626 messages.

# AI Phishing Detection Hackathon - URGENT Dataset Research & Acquisition Task

## Challenge Overview
We're participating in the **AfriHackBox AI-Powered Phishing Detection Challenge** with an **8-day deadline** (currently Day 1). The goal is to build an AI system that detects phishing attempts in SMS, WhatsApp, and email for Africa's mobile money users (600M+ users, $1.4T annual transactions).

## Key Requirements
- **Detection Accuracy:** 95%+ with <2% false positives
- **Languages:** Swahili, Yoruba, Amharic, Arabic, French, Hausa (we're prioritizing: Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, Pidgin, French, Arabic, Amharic)
- **Device Constraints:** Must run on basic smartphones (1-2GB RAM)
- **Offline Operation:** 72+ hours without internet
- **Battery Efficiency:** <5% per day

## Team Composition
- 2 mobile developers
- 1 cybersecurity expert
- 1 business/entrepreneurial person
- 1 software engineer (comfortable with web, mobile, cloud)

## Current Situation

### CRITICAL BLOCKER
The hackathon organizers promised "curated datasets" worth $10K+ but they're not available yet. We've submitted a support request but can't wait for their response.

### Our Multi-Pronged Solution
1. ✅ **Crowdsourcing Campaign** - Launched (Google Form across social media)
2. ✅ **Synthetic Data Generator** - Built (generates 1,300+ messages per language for 9 languages: English, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, Pidgin, French, Arabic, Amharic)
3. 🔥 **PUBLIC DATASET ACQUISITION** - **THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN**

## Timeline Context
- **TODAY (Day 1):** Dataset research & acquisition ← **WE ARE HERE**
- **Tomorrow (Day 2):** Dataset processing + model selection
- **Days 3-4:** Model training + mobile app foundation
- **Days 5-6:** Integration + testing
- **Days 7-8:** Polish + submission

**We need a complete, production-ready dataset by END OF TODAY.**

---

# 🎯 PRIMARY TASK: BUILD US A COMPLETE DATASET

## Your Mission

You are a data scientist hired to **build a production-ready multilingual phishing detection dataset**. We received a research brief from Gemini AI with 20 potential sources. Your job is to:

1. **Research every single source** - Verify accessibility, explore actual content
2. **Download/Access all viable datasets** - Get the actual data
3. **Process & clean the data** - Standardize formats, labels, remove noise
4. **Combine datasets intelligently** - Merge sources without introducing bias
5. **Validate quality** - Ensure the final dataset is training-ready
6. **Deliver the complete dataset** - As CSV/JSON with proper documentation

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You must deliver:**
- ✅ A combined dataset with **minimum 20,000 messages**
- ✅ Coverage for **at least 5 languages** (English, French, Swahili + 2 African languages)
- ✅ Balanced labels (30-40% phishing, 60-70% legitimate)
- ✅ Proper columns: `message`, `label`, `language`, `source`, `scam_type`
- ✅ Documentation: Stats, source breakdown, processing notes
- ✅ Ready-to-use train/validation/test splits

**DO NOT just give us instructions. We need the actual processed dataset files.**

# 📚 FULL GEMINI RESEARCH BRIEF

## Context from Gemini

Since we don't have the curated dataset yet, this is actually a golden opportunity. We can build our own foundational understanding and even create a baseline model. This will put us miles ahead when the official data is released.

### Phase 1: Research & Data (The Proactive Approach)

Our goal is to understand the enemy. What do these phishing messages actually look like in Africa? How do they manipulate people?

We will tackle this in two parts:

**Find Public Datasets to Act as Proxies:** We'll find existing public datasets for SMS spam and phishing. While they won't have the specific cultural nuances, they are essential for building and testing our initial data processing and modeling pipeline.

**Research African Phishing Tactics:** We will become domain experts by researching the specific strategies scammers use in our target regions.

### Part 1: Gathering Proxy Datasets

While we await the official data, we can start with publicly available datasets. This allows us to write code for data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.

Here's what Gemini found and how we can use it:

**For English & French:** The UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset is a well-known benchmark. Several versions exist on platforms like Kaggle, some of which have been machine-translated into other languages, including French. There's also a corpus of over 88,000 authentic French SMS messages which could be invaluable for understanding the language's informal, text-based nature.

**For Swahili:** While a direct "phishing" dataset is rare, there are several Swahili news classification datasets available. We can use the non-news text (the "ham") from these to teach our model what normal Swahili looks like. We'll have to be creative and likely generate or manually label some Swahili phishing examples.

**For Yoruba & Other African Languages:** A dataset with "African-English context" was collected in Nigeria, which could be very useful for understanding local phrasing. Zindi, a platform for African data science challenges, is another excellent resource to monitor for datasets in our target languages.

**General Phishing:** There are multiple general-purpose smishing (SMS phishing) datasets on GitHub and Mendeley Data that consolidate messages from public sources. These are great for training our model on the fundamental structure of phishing messages.

**Action Plan for Data:** We'll start by downloading the UCI dataset and one of its multilingual versions. This gives us English and French data to build our initial model. We will then incorporate the Swahili news data to help the model learn that language.

### Part 2: Researching Cultural Context & Phishing Patterns

This is where we go beyond generic spam. The hackathon explicitly states that traditional solutions fail because they "don't understand African languages, cultural nuances, or the technical constraints."

Research into common mobile money and online scams in Africa reveals several recurring themes that we must teach our model to recognize:

**Impersonation is Key:** Scammers frequently pose as representatives from mobile money operators (like M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money), banks, or even family members.

**The "Mistaken Transfer" Scam:** A very common tactic involves a scammer sending a fake alert that money was sent to the victim's account, followed by a desperate call or text asking for the money to be "refunded." The victim, wanting to be honest, sends their own money without verifying their balance.

**Exploiting Trust and Authority:** Messages might reference government grants, fake job offers with "application fees," or use titles like "Uncle" or "Auntie" to create a false sense of familiarity and trust.

**SIM Swap Fraud:** The underlying threat for many attacks is SIM swapping, where a fraudster convinces a mobile operator to transfer the victim's number to a new SIM card they control, giving them access to everything. While we can't detect the swap itself, we can detect the social engineering messages that often precede it (e.g., asking for personal details to "verify your account").

**Urgency and Scarcity:** Like phishing everywhere, messages create a sense of urgency (e.g., "your account will be suspended," "claim your prize NOW") to prevent victims from thinking critically.

# 🎯 YOUR SPECIFIC TASKS

## Task 1: Source Verification & Exploration (Top Priority)

For **EACH of the 20 sources above**, you must:

1. **Verify the link is live and accessible**
   - If dead/requires special access, mark as "SKIP"
   - If accessible, mark as "VIABLE"

2. **Determine actual contents**
   - How many samples?
   - What languages?
   - What format (CSV, JSON, TXT)?
   - Labeled or unlabeled?
   - What labels (spam/ham, phishing/legitimate, etc.)?

3. **Load, explore or access the data** (if possible via web tools/APIs) 
   - Provide direct download links
   - Provide access code snippets if programmatic

4. **Extract key samples**
   - Show us 3-5 example messages from each dataset
   - This proves you actually accessed the data

5. **Assess relevance score (1-10)**
   - 10 = Perfect for our use case
   - 5 = Useful with processing
   - 1 = Not relevant

## Task 2: Data Processing & Standardization

For all VIABLE datasets:

1. **Explore the data** (provide download commands/scripts) 

2. **Process to standard format:**
   ```
   Columns: message, label, language, source, scam_type
   Labels: "phishing" or "legitimate"
   Encoding: UTF-8
   Format: CSV
   ```

3. **Clean the data:**
   - Remove duplicates
   - Remove empty/null messages
   - Fix encoding issues
   - Standardize label names
   - Add language detection if missing

4. **Validate quality:**
   - Check for data leakage
   - Verify label distribution
   - Sample 10 messages for manual review

## Task 3: Dataset Combination & Balancing

1. **Combine all processed datasets** into one master dataset

2. **Balance the data:**
   - Ensure no single source dominates (max 40% from any one source)
   - Maintain 30-40% phishing, 60-70% legitimate ratio
   - Stratify by language (similar counts per language)

3. **Create splits:**
   - Training: 70%
   - Validation: 15%
   - Test: 15%
   - Stratify by language AND label

## Task 4: Documentation & Delivery

Provide:

1. **Dataset Statistics Report:**
   ```
   Total Messages: X
   
   By Language:
   - English: X (Y% phishing)

   - Swahili: X (Y% phishing)
   - [etc.]
   
   By Source:
   - UCI: X messages
   - Kaggle Multilingual: X messages
   - [etc.]
   
   Label Distribution:
   - Phishing: X (Y%)
   - Legitimate: X (Y%)
   ```

2. **Processing Notes:**
   - What cleaning was done

   - Already labeled data
   - Open licenses

4. **Skip datasets that:**
   - Require academic approval
   - Are behind paywalls
   - Have dead links
   - Don't contain text messages

5. **Quality over quantity:**
   - 10,000 clean, diverse messages > 50,000 duplicated/low-quality messages

---

# 📊 SECONDARY TASKS (Lower Priority)

## Secondary Task 1: Manual Research Guide

Create a step-by-step guide for humans to manually replicate your process:
- Which sources to explore first

About Dataset
Context
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

Content
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

This corpus has been collected from free or free for research sources at the Internet:

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is: [Web Link].
-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The NUS SMS Corpus is avalaible at: [Web Link].
-> A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at [Web Link].
-> Finally, we have incorporated the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. It has 1,002 SMS ham messages and 322 spam messages and it is public available at: [Web Link]. This corpus has been used in the following academic researches:
