# Whitelist-style .easignore: ignore everything except the files explicitly needed
# This keeps the EAS upload small while ensuring the app and runtime model artifacts
# are still included. Because you have native code in `android/`, we explicitly
# include it (do NOT add /android to .easignore unless you want EAS to run prebuild).

# Ignore everything by default
**

# Keep these project-level files so EAS can build the app
!/.easignore
!/package.json
!/pnpm-lock.yaml
!/app.json
!/eas.json
!/tsconfig.json
!/tailwind.config.js
!/metro.config.js
!/metro.config.cjs
!/global.css

# Keep source app code and assets
!/app/**
!/assets/**

# Keep native Android folder (you have native code that must be built)
!/android/**

# Include only the runtime model artifacts we need from the phishing package
!/phishing_detector_package/phishing_detector_dynamic.tflite
!/phishing_detector_package/tokenizer/**
!/phishing_detector_package/model-metadata.json

# Developer-friendly: include README and LICENSE if present
!/README.md
!/LICENSE*

# Note: everything else (server/, dataset/, notebooks/, node_modules/, logs, zip files)
# will be excluded by the leading `**` pattern above.
